# MxOSource - Matrix Online Server Emulator based on Rajkosto Reality Code
MxOSource Backup from their trunks before their SVN went down.
Dont know if it is complete - but better as nothing.

All Credits goes to http://www.mxosource.com

Trunks:
- **mxosource-Trunk.r2** - This was the last playable version (many features but buggy)
- **NewBuild-CombatPhaseOne.r84** - Clean Start with rajkos source - dunno how far it was
- **mxosource_new_build** - Another Trunk but was cleanup too - starting point was original rajko code

I uploaded this stuff to have the backups from all MxO related stuff somewhere in the internet where everyone can access it.

## Enviroent Setup 
See https://github.com/rajkosto/mxoemu/wiki/Environment-Setup

## Database
Well this was nearly imcomplete so i mixed rajkos data tables and their structure (but still data is missing their)
